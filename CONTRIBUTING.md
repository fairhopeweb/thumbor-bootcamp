# Contributing with thumbor-bootcamp

You can contribute in many ways:

* Being a mentor to bootcampers and helping ease them into open-source contributing, while moving thumbor forward;
* Being a bootcamper, driving impact while learning more about open-source contributions and tech;
* Helping organize the bootcamp and spreading the word so we get more and more bootcampers.

Whatever path you choose, please create an issue with your request and we'll answer as soon as possible.

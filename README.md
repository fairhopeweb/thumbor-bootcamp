thumbor bootcamp is a program to ease new contributors into thumbor's ecosystem, while learning more about open-source collaboration and technology.

### üïµÔ∏è Who's invited?

Anyone can collaborate with thumbor as a bootcamper.

* If you are a software engineer you can fix bugs, write new tests, create new features.
* If you are a product manager you can help us organize these tasks and create new ones to move thumbor forward.
* If you are a designer you can help us improve thumbor's visual identity, website and our overall brand.
* If you are a content strategist you can help us get better at documenting and onboarding new users.

We could keep going, but the truth is there's room for colaboration on so many levels, that it's best if you just reach out and we can go from there.

### Bootcamp Tasks

Bootcamp tasks are how you interact with this learning experience. We believe in learning through action.

Thumbor will have bootcamp tasks divided by area of expertise and level.

#### Areas of Expertise

Some examples:

* Onboarding
* Documentation
* Website
* Brand
* Extensibility
* Imaging and Image Quality
* Performance
* Maintainability
* Security
* Reliability

A task could be part of more than one area of expertise, but these will help you in figuring out which task is just right for you.

#### Task Levels

```
Disclaimer:

  These tasks consider an investment of 2h a day.
  If you are investing less time, no worries, just adjust your expectations.

  The expectation of time it takes to complete is also an estimate.
  It is by no means a deadline or something like it.

  **It's done when it's done.**

  We just ask that if you feel like you won't be able to keep working on something,
  you update the task to allow someone else to work on it.
```

* L1 - Low effort. Single module/file. ~1d to complete - This is the bread and butter for people joining thumbor-bootcamp. **This is where you start**.
* L2 - Medium effort. Single module/file. ~3-4d to complete - Requires some knowledge about how thumbor and its parts work.
* L3 - Medium effort. Multiple modules. ~2w to complete - This is a project level task. It involves discussing what you are doing, creating tests, updating docs. This is where you actually start learning about what it takes to keep a project the size of thumbor with momentum.
* L4 - Large effort. Multiple modules. ~1m to complete - This is a transformative task that greatly benefits the ecosystem and the community. Once you complete a few of these, we expect to welcome you to the maintainers team, so you can also help onboard other bootcampers.

### Getting started

### Commitment

What is expected of you?

* ü§¢ **Do not bite more than you can chew!** Pick up tasks you feel confident in completing. This helps the community as we keep moving forward as well as keeps you motivated!
* ü§ó **Be kind!** Always assume good intention as we're all trying to create incredible technology and have fun at the same time!
* üßò **Be patient!** In an open-source project people are donating their time to create good in the world. Thumbor is not different. Maintainers and contributors have families and jobs. We'll help as fast as we can.
* ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Be a force for good!** Whenever you can try to help other bootcampers, create or groom tasks here, improve documentation. Anything you feel is leaving a better world than what you started with.
* ‚öñÔ∏è  **Be respectful!** We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We will not tolerate usage of words that enforce negative stereotypes. If this is not ok with you, this is not the project for you.

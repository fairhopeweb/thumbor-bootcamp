### üì∑ What is thumbor? Ecosystem?

[thumbor](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor) is an extensible imaging HTTP server. It crops, resizes and transforms images on-demand and serves this images to users.

The extensible nature of thumbor means there are dozens of projects that extend it. Image loaders, storages and results storages, filters, detectors and much more.

Apart from these extensions there's all sort of programming language and web framework integrations.

This is what we call thumbor's ecosystem. All the cool projects that extend and improve thumbor's usage all over the world. You can learn more about it at [awesome-thumbor](https://github.com/thumbor/awesome-thumbor).

These extensions allow thumbor to run in almost any architecture and cloud out there: AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean and even self-hosted. There are people using Redis, MongoDB, Postgres, Ceph, S3 and many others for storage of images, and the number of possibilities is endless.

You can explore that and more in [thumbor's docs](https://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### ü™ñ Bootcamp Tasks

Bootcamp tasks are how you interact with this learning experience. We believe in learning through action.

Thumbor will have bootcamp tasks divided by area of expertise and level.

#### Areas of Expertise

These will be labels in tasks and help you pick something that interests you.

Some examples:

* Onboarding
* Documentation
* Website & Branding
* Extensibility
* Imaging and Image Quality
* Performance
* Maintainability

#### Task Levels

```
Disclaimer:

  These tasks consider an investment of 2h a day.
  If you are investing less time, no worries, just adjust your expectations.

  The expectation of time it takes to complete is also an estimate.
  It is by no means a deadline or something like it.

  **It's done when it's done.**

  We just ask that if you feel like you won't be able to keep working on something,
  you update the task to allow someone else to work on it.
```

| Level | Effort | Expected Duration | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1 | Low | ~1d | Single file/module |  This is the bread and butter for people joining thumbor-bootcamp. **This is where you start**. |

* L1 - Low effort. Single module/file. ~1d to complete - This is the bread and butter for people joining thumbor-bootcamp. **This is where you start**.
* L2 - Medium effort. Single module/file. ~3-4d to complete - Requires some knowledge about how thumbor and its parts work.
* L3 - Medium effort. Multiple modules. ~2w to complete - This is a project level task. It involves discussing what you are doing, creating tests, updating docs. This is where you actually start learning about what it takes to keep a project the size of thumbor with momentum.
* L4 - Large effort. Multiple modules. ~1m to complete - This is a transformative task that greatly benefits the ecosystem and the community. Once you complete a few of these, we expect to welcome you to the maintainers team, so you can also help onboard other bootcampers.

### ü§ù Commitment

What is expected of you?

* ü§¢ **Do not bite more than you can chew!** Pick up tasks you feel confident in completing. This helps the community as we keep moving forward as well as keeps you motivated!
